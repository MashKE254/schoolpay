/**
 * get_class_details.php
 *
 * AJAX endpoint to fetch comprehensive details for a specific class.
 *
 * This script is responsible for:
 * - Validating that a valid class ID is provided in the request.
 * - Ensuring the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions for their school.
 * - Fetching the main details for the specified class from the 'classes' table.
 * - Fetching a complete list of students (id, name, status, and individual balance) associated with that class.
 * - Calculating a financial summary (total invoiced, total paid, and current balance) for the entire class.
 * - Returning all the collected data as a single, well-structured JSON object for the frontend to consume.
